About this repository

This repository hosts small front-end projects covering layout, styling, animations, DOM manipulation, and vanilla JavaScript patterns. Projects are lightweight, dependency-free unless explicitly noted, and intended to be easy to open and run in a browser.

How projects are organized

Each project lives in its own directory at the repository root. A typical project folder contains:

- index.html — the entry point
- styles.css (or a css folder) — stylesheet(s)
- script.js (or a js folder) — JavaScript logic
- assets/ — images, fonts, or other static assets
- README.md — a per-project README with detailed information (see the template below)

If a project requires a build step or uses a framework/tooling, that will be documented in the project's README.

Project README template

Use this template for each project to keep documentation consistent and professional.
